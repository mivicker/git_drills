This is the initial version of the file.

Except not because I've added this text.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Now I'm going to try to change something different on both branches.
-> This causes an error and no update. But what happens when I pull after I've made changes?

Okay--using pull without any more keywords when I didn't change anything on this branch just updates the file to the most recent on the remote repository.
